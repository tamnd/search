// Package vfs is the virtual-filesystem seam (spec 2063 doc 03, doc 20). The
// pager and WAL run over a VFS rather than the os package directly, so tests can
// substitute a fault-injecting backend that crashes the engine at any write or
// fsync boundary and simulates torn writes and fsync failures. This seam is the
// spine of all crash-recovery testing.
//
// The interface is deliberately small: open/create/remove/exists a named file,
// and per-file positioned read/write, truncate, sync, size, and close. Every
// durability guarantee in search is expressed in terms of these operations, so a
// faithful in-memory model of them is a faithful model of the engine's
// durability.
